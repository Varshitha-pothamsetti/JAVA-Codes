What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

PYTHON: Is a dynamically typed programming language
Numeric types--> int ,float ,complex
sequence types--> list, tuple, range
string type--> str
set type--> set, frozentset
mapping type--> dict

SEPARATORS:
In python by default uses a space as a separator

END;
it is used to mention with what type of string the print() statement should end
by default its is a newline character

Getting input from the user
input() --> built in function which will let take input from user
input() reads every string

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
int
find out sum of three number
a, b, c=map(int, input().split())
7:42:37
h, m, s=map(int, input().split(':'))

input()-->for taking input as a single string '10,20,30'
split()--> '10,20,30' --> ['10', '20', '30']
map()--> converting those strings into integers and assigned them to a, b and c respectively

#using formatting:
printf("sum %d  %d and %d is %d"%(a,b,c))
#using .format() method on nstrings
print("sum of {} and {} is {}" .format(a,b,c))
#using formatted string (f strings since 3.6)
#literal string interpolation
print(f"sum of{a} and {b} and {a+b}")

a=12.345
print(a)
#using % formatting
print("%.2f" %(a))
#using  .format() method
print("{:2f}


ARTHIMETIC OPERATIONS IN PYTHON :
+
-
*
/
%
// --> Floor division(floored quotient)
** --> Exponentiation(power)
float division reduces the actual quotient to nearest integer

LISTS :
--> lists are ordered collection of elements
-->  elements  be enclosed with square brackets
--> lists are indexed
--> index starts from 0
--> lists are make change to the list even after creation
--> lists are the homogenous and heterogenous

ord ():
--> built_in function which take a character and return its ASCII code point value
ex: print(ord('a'))

DICTONARY(MAPPING TYPE):
--> key: value pairs
keys can only be of mutable types
values can be of any type
you can get values mapped to a key using dict name[key]
-dictionaries will not hold duplicate keys
-dictionaries will always in {}
--> word: meaning
--> book: price
--> book: author

OPERATIONS IN PYTHON :
1. Arthimetic operations(+,-,*,%.//,**)
2. Relational(>,<=,<,<=,==,!=)
3. logical(and,or ,not)
4> Bitwise ($, |, ^ ,<< , >> ,~)
5> Assign(=)
          Compound assignment
           +=, -= , *=, //,**=
